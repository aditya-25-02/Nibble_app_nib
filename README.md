## Quick Questions

#### Why i chose this project?
I always wanted to make an application and wanted to see people using it around me. This idea came up to my mind when we were asked to do some summer projects, we have always contributed technological stuff to our college but, I wanted to contribute something useful to this society.

#### What are the issue i faced in making this application?
To be very honest this whole project was a tough deal for me, i had zero experience with Kotlin & Android. I tried, failed, learned, tried again and built.
I see a huge difference in me in these 30 days of summer-project. I know a lot more about Android than before. I still encounter flaws in my building, i might not be using the most efficient or professional way of building . But atleast i have learnt a lot and i am very thankful to every senior to push me everytime.
